      description: "C++ is a high-performance, general-purpose programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1985 as an extension of C. It supports both procedural and object-oriented programming, making it ideal for system/software development, game engines, and embedded systems. Known for its speed and efficiency, C++ is widely used in applications requiring real-time processing, such as financial systems and AAA video games. Despite its steep learning curve, it remains a cornerstone of performance-critical software development.",

      description: "HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are the foundational technologies for building and styling web pages. HTML structures content, while CSS controls layout, colors, and fonts. Together, they enable responsive and visually appealing websites. Modern features like Flexbox, Grid, and animations have expanded their capabilities. Essential for front-end development, they work alongside JavaScript to create dynamic user experiences. Every web developer starts with these core languages.",
